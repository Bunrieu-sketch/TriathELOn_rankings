    "## Introduction\n",
    "The aim of this analysis is to develop a new ranking system for elite triathletes competing on the [ITU triathlon](triathlon.org) World Triathlon Series, which is the top level of international triathlon competition. The ranking system is be an application of the famous [Glicko ranking system](http://glicko.net/glicko.html), most commonly used for international chess rankings. After the new ranking system is established, it will be tested against the ITU's internal ranking system to determine which is superior in terms of predictive power. Ideally, the end goal of this project is to use this ranking system to track athlete development, and backtrack athlete `podium pathways`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is the Glicko rating system?\n",
    "The Glicko rating system was created by Professor Mark Glickman to expand and improve upon the famous [Elo rating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system), which attempted to probabilistically rate chess players based on the results of their matches. In both the `Elo` and `Glicko` rating systems, each player is associated with a `Player Rating`, and the differences in Ratings between the two players is what drives the prediction for the outcome of a match. The larger the difference between two players, the higher the system will predict the stronger player's chances to win. After each match rating points are transferred from the losing player to the winning player in a zero sum fashion and both players ratings are updated. The pre match Rating differences between the two players is what determines the amount of Rating points transferred between the players. If one player was heavily favoured and won the match, then not a lot of Rating points are transferred (this match has not provided much additional information to the system), however for two closely ranked players, larger Ratings point changes will occur. <br><br>\n",
    "The Glicko system expands upon the Elo system by adding a reliability measure to a players Rating, or RD (Ratings Deviation). In this way, players who have played more games and played more recently will have lower Ratings Deviations, and players who have not played in a long time will intuitively have higher Rating's Deviations. Additional information and examples about the `Glicko` formula can be found [here](http://www.glicko.net/glicko/glicko.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Glicko Rating System for triathlon?\n",
    "The International Triathlon Union has their own internal ranking system, where athletes accrue ranking points at the three levels of ITU competition (Continental Cups, World Cups, and World Triathlon Series), and are ranked according to their point totals. The amount of points an athlete earns are standardized based on the level of the event, with the winner of a Continental Cup earning $250$ points, a World Cup $500$ points, and a World Triathlon Series event $1000$ points. While the points given at are uniform at a given level or ace, the level of the competition you face is not. Some events are loaded with the top athletes, while for whatever reason, other races may be weak. It is because of these cases where I believe the Glicko ranking system will be a superior measure of an athletes ability than the ITU ranking system, as Ratings points are given out based solely on the quality of the athletes you race.   \n",
    "\n",
    "## Adapting Glicko rating system to ITU triathlon\n",
    "Both the Glicko and Elo rating systems were designed and derived with $2$-player zero sum games like chess in mind. To use the system in a triathlon context I will turn an $n$-person triathlon race into $(n)(n-1)/2$ individual `one-vs-one` races. There are a couple potential issues with this approach which will be discussed later. Additionally, a \"ratings period\" must be determined for each race, as in the Glicko system, the longer since a player has played their last game, the higher is their Ratings Deviation. Somewhat arbitrarily, during a WTS season I have set the difference between races to be \"1 period\" and the difference from the last race of a season and the first race of the next season to be \"6 periods\", so that periods roughly align with months passed. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Data \n",
    "The data used to construct the Ratings includes all WTS results from 2009 (when the WTS series was created) until the end of 2019, for both men and women. These results were accessed using [triathlon.org API](https://developers.triathlon.org/), but all results can also be downloaded via CSV from [triathlon.org results](https://triathlon.org/results). For each race, I create a dataframe of normal race results including all finishers, their places, times and their swim-bike-run splits. Additionally, in order to apply the `glicko` formula to an $n$ person triathlon race, I also created in a `one-vs-one` dataframe, with $n(n-1)/2$ rows, each row giving the result of the `one vs one` race between each pair of competitors.<br> \n",
    "\n",
    "Cleaned race-results, as well as the `one-vs-one` constructed dataframes, are included in the `data` directory, as well as the notebook showing how data was accessed and wrangled from the API.  Functions used in this process are included in the `src` directory. \n",

    "## Ranking metrics\n",
    "In order to compare different ranking systems (`ITU` vs. `Glicko`),  some objective metrics are needed, and I used two different metrics,   `adjusted R-squared` and `Kendall's tau`.  The pre-race ranking of the athlete was used as the independent variable, and race result was used as the dependent variable. <br>\n",
    "- The`R-squared` measure is widely used as measure of goodness of fit in a linear regression, and measures the proportion of variation in the dependent variable explained by the independent variable, with a measure of $0$ indicating no relationship, and a measure of $1.0$ indicating a perfect fit.\n",
    "- `Kendall's tau` coefficient measures the ordinal relationship between two columns. To compare two \"pre-race rankings\", one can calculate a `Kendall's tau` coefficient between each ranking and the final race results, and see which ranking system has a higher coefficient. A `Kendall's tau` of 0 indicates no relationship, and a `Kendall's tau` value of 1 indicates a perfect relationship. \n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for `Kendall's tau` is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{kendall's tau} = \\frac{\\text{number of concordant pairs - number of discordant pairs}}{\\text{total number of pairs}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the vectors $[1,2,3]$ and $[1,3,2]$ would have a `Kendall's tau` coefficient of $\\frac{1}{3}, calculated as:<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{2 - 1}{3} = 0.333\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Parameters of the Glicko model\n",
    "I used the `PlayerRatings` [R package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/PlayerRatings/PlayerRatings.pdf) in order to implement the Glicko algorithm. The model has a few parameters which needed to be set or learned, specified below.\n",
    "- __Initial value of players__\n",
    "    - For new players entering the system, they are given the default values from the `PlayerRatings` package of a Rating of $1500$, and a Rating Deviation of $350$. In the first race, everyone is new and all start with this rating, but as the season and years progress the number of new racers entering with the default Rating decreases. \n",
    "- __Uncertainty parameter c__\n",
    "    - In the `glicko` formula, the ratings deviation of a player will decrease with every performance gathered from them, and the ratings deviation of a player will increase the greater period of time since their last performance. The parameter `c` is governs the increase in uncertainty between ratings periods.\n",
    "    - To determine the optimal level of `c` was chosen via Grid search. At each level of `c`, the model is trained over the full time period, with the `R^2` being calculated for each race. The average `R^2` across the full $10$ years is recorded. The level of c is chosen by the arg. max of average `R^2`\n",
    "    \n",
    "__Process to determine the optimal value of c__<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- for each level of C\n",
    "    - for each race in the dataset<br>\n",
    "        - update race results dataframe with previous Glicko rankings, and rank athletes according to their Glicko rankings\n",
    "        - determine Kendall's tau correlation between Glicko rankings and their finish results\n",
    "        - determine R^2 between Glicko rankings and their finish results\n",
    "        - use the results of the race to appropriately update the Glicko rankings\n",
