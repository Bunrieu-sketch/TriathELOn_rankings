## Data Sources in TriathELOn project
Races included in the modelling are the 2009-2010 World Triathlon Series men's results.

 The 2009 results have been downloaded directly from [triathlon.org](https://triathlon.org/results#q=&hPP=15&idx=events_reverse_sort&p=0&dFR%5Bevent_categories.cat_name%5D%5B0%5D=World%20Triathlon%20Series&dFR%5Byear%5D%5B0%5D=2009&fR%5Bfederation_event%5D%5B0%5D=false&is_v=1). <br>
 The cleaning process for this data is in the [2009 cleaning notebook](nba.com)<br><br>
 The 2010 results were queried from the [Triathlon Developers API](https://developers.triathlon.org/). The code to query  for these results can be seen in the [2010 extraction notebook](nba.com), while the cleaning code is in the [2010 cleaning notebook](nba.com).
